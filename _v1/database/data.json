Today, getting performance metrics from industrial equipment is tough because data is often locked into proprietary on-premises data stores and typically requires specialized expertise to retrieve it and put it in a format that is useful for searching and analysis. IoT SiteWise simplifies this process by providing software running on a gateway that resides in your facilities and automates the process of collecting and organizing industrial equipment data. This gateway securely connects to your on-premises data servers, collects data, and sends the data to the AWS Cloud. You can run the IoT SiteWise software on an AWS Snowball Edge gateway or install the IoT SiteWise software on popular third-party industrial gateways. These gateways are specifically designed for industrial environments that are likely already in your facilities connecting your industrial equipment.  You can use IoT SiteWise to monitor operations across facilities, quickly compute common industrial performance metrics, and build applications to analyze industrial equipment data, prevent costly equipment issues, and reduce production inefficiencies. With IoT SiteWise, you can focus on understanding and optimizing your operations, rather than building costly in-house data collection and management applications. ",

AWS License Manager lets administrators create customized licensing rules that emulate the terms of their licensing agreements, and then enforces these rules when an instance of EC2 gets launched. Administrators can use these rules to limit licensing violations, such as using more licenses than an agreement stipulates or reassigning licenses to different servers on a short-term basis. The rules in AWS License Manager enable you to limit a licensing breach by physically stopping the instance from launching or by notifying administrators about the infringement. Administrators gain control and visibility of all their licenses with the AWS License Manager dashboard and reduce the risk of non-compliance, misreporting, and additional costs due to licensing overages.

A dedicated 1Gbps network connection theoretically moves 1PB of data in 100 days -- and in the real world, likely longer and at higher cost. Migrating data-intensive analytics environments, moving enterprise datacenters to the cloud, re-invigorating digital archives requires bulk data transport methods that are simple, affordable, secure and tamper-resistant. And for workloads at remote edge locations, data may also need to be pre-processed with onboard device computing power.",
